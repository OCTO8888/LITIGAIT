Hello{% if name %} {{ name }}{% endif %},

I'm Brian, the co-founder of Free Law Project, the non-profit that sponsors the development of CourtListener. I saw that you recently signed up, and I just wanted to say hello and welcome you to the site.

Whether you'd just like to set up some daily alerts for topics that interest you, download all our data (for free!), or even contribute somehow to our efforts, I'm glad you've signed up and would be happy to try to help you with whatever you're trying to do.

Let me know if you can't figure something out or if you have a suggestion on how things could be better. I hope you enjoy the site!
