    <h4 id="who-and-what">What is this site? Who runs it?</h4>

    <p>CourtListener is a legal research website currently containing <a
            href="/coverage/">{{ total_opinion_count|intcomma }}</a> legal opinions from federal and state courts.
        CourtListener is operated by the non-profit <a
                href="http://freelawproject.org">Free Law Project</a>. Free Law Project seeks to provide free access to
        primary legal materials, develop legal research tools, and support academic research on legal corpora.
        CourtListener embodies all of these efforts, as the primary free repository of all the court opinions we have
        collected, as the platform on which we attempt to deploy legal research tools, and as the source of bulk
        downloads that enable academic researchers to study our collection.
    </p>

    <h4 id="contact">How do I contact you?</h4>

    <p>We can be contacted via the address on our <a href="/contact/">contact form</a>, or via email at
        <a href="mailto:info@freelawproject.org">info@freelawproject.org</a>. If you require a secure channel when
        contacting us, please use the PGP key listed
        <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xDE79459CD047ACFE">here</a>.

    <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
    <h4 id="why-use">Why should I use this site (and not something else)?</h4>

    <p>While Free Law Project seeks to put the entirety of United States case law online, for the
        public, for free, we have not reached that goal yet. So, we hope you find what you are looking
        for here, but if not, you should absolutely use other sites too! Other no-cost sites include
        <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="http://www.justia.com/">
            Justia</a>. There are many fee-based sites too, including <a href="http://fastcase.com/">Fastcase</a>
        and <a href="http://www.casemaker.us/">Casemaker</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="how-different">What makes this site different from other sites that put legal documents
        online?</h4>

    <p>Our site has a citator that shows you which subsequent opinions have cited to the opinion you
        are viewing, an important tool in researching whether a given precedent is still good law. Many free
        sites lack such a tool. We also think our search filters, advanced search options, and relevancy
        search enhancements that we call
        <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2013/11/12/courtlistener-improves-search-results-thanks-to-volunteer-contributor/">
            CiteGeist</a>, produce search results that are particularly impressive.</p>

    <p>Unlike many sites that may be several days or weeks behind, we strive to collect new opinions from
        the courts in near real time. For <a href="/coverage/#scraped-jurisdictions">the courts we cover</a>, new
        opinions should typically appear within 30 minutes of being posted on the court's website.</p>

    <p>But the most important distinguishing factor about this site is that it is <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>.
        Anyone can download all the source code we use to operate this site and run their own site that does exactly
        the same thing. And since our bulk downloads provide free access to our entire collection of opinions, we hope
        we've given our effort its own life that can continue no matter what. Many <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltLaw">people</a> <a
                href="http://library2.lawschool.cornell.edu/insiteasp/public/display_browse.asp?style=st_browse&id=1542&prevpage=1Legal">have</a> <a
                href="http://library2.lawschool.cornell.edu/insiteasp/public/display_browse.asp?style=st_browse&id=1207&prevpage=2Court">tried</a>
        to provide free access to U.S. case law, but when their efforts finally end, their collection and software
        typically disappears too and the next effort has to start over from the beginning. We hope instead to be the
        last people who ever have to attempt to collect the entirety of United States case law. Everyone who comes after
        can build upon this effort.</p>

    <h4 id="explain-alerts">What are alerts and how do they work?</h4>
    <p>You can sign up to receive free daily, weekly or monthly email alerts for any search query that interests you.
        When a new opinion matches your search, you'll get an email alert at about 5:30 Pacific time. Get started
        by running a search and the "Create an alert" option will be in the sidebar next to your results.</p>
    <p>Note that alerts are only currently supported in <a href="/coverage/#scraped-jurisdictions">
        {{ scraped_court_count }} jurisdictions</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="explain-citations">How do you identify citations?</h4>
    <p>It's not easy. Currently we only detect citaitons to court opinions. Citations to statutes, law
        review articles, or other resources are currently ignored. When a new document is added, we search
        the document text for standard case law citation formats and if we can match what we find with one (and
        only one) document in our collection, then we create a hyperlink from the original document's citation
        to the cited document, making it easier to browse through our collection. When there are multiple
        documents in our collection that appear to match the citation we use what we call "reverse matching"
        to try to resolve the citation. The case name from each potential match is searched in the original document
        and if there is only one match, then that becomes the linked citation.</p>

    <h3 id="coverage-and-content">Coverage and Content</h3>
    <h4 id="what-coverage-exists">What is your coverage of legal materials and how comprehensive is
        it?</h4>

    <p>See our <a href="/coverage/">coverage</a> page for all the details. We are
        constantly working to fill gaps in our coverage, but until we have the entirety of United States case law,
        you should consult additional sources for any important legal research task.</p>

    <p>When we think we are closer to having everything, we intend to conduct an "audit" of our documents to
        confirm that we have every opinion that appears in the bound volumes of case law. Once that audit is complete,
        we will be able to post even more details about our coverage.</p>

    <h4 id="why-many-copies">Why do some opinions show up more than once in search results?</h4>
    <p>CourtListener uses an automatic process to find and download opinions on court websites. This is an extremely
        efficient and effective method of finding new opinions as they are posted, but in some cases, a court will post
        several edits to an opinion. Sometimes these edits are for seemingly minor typos, but other times they can be
        the result of something more interesting, like <a
                href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/antonin-scalia-error-supreme-court-dissent-epa">a judicial
            blunder</a>. When this happens, we maintain an archive of all of the versions of that opinion.
    </p>
    <p>We've discussed this topic in more depth <a
            href="http://freelawproject.org/2014/05/03/detecting-judicial-corrections/">on our blog</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="why-my-case">Why is the opinion in my case appearing on this site?</h4>
    <p>Court opinions are public records and create the precedents that determine the results in future cases.
        Court opinions contain statements of the law and legal reasoning that guide legal researchers. We are
        attempting to build a site useful to legal researchers. If you have a concern about information from one
        of these opinions appearing in search engines, such as Google, you should review our <a
                href="/removal/">removal policy</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="non-precedential">Why does this site contain documents that say "Not for Publication",
        "Unpublished" etc?</h4>
    <p>In many jurisdictions of the United States, these statements do not mean that the case should not be
        published. Instead, it means that the issuing court is claiming they should not be used as a precedent in
        subsequent cases. You can read more about this policy <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-publication_of_legal_opinions_in_the_United_States">on
            Wikipedia</a>, if you are interested in the details.
    </p>

    <h4 id="explain-pin-cites">What are the gray numbers that appear in the middle of many opinions?</h4>
    <p>These numbers correspond to the page numbers in the original books where these opinions were first published,
        and are commonly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_citation">pin-cites</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="explain-neutral-citations">What are neutral citations and why do you promote them?</h4>
    <p>Historically, citations have corresponded to the location in a book where an opinion could be found. But for
        online systems like CourtListener this presents a number of problems. First, there's the obvious problem that
        when an opinion is created by a court and posted on its website, there is no way to refer to it until it is
        published in a book. In a post-Internet world, this is an unusual and unfortunate outcome. Second, there is
        no clear way for a system like CourtListener to determine the citation for an opinion once the opinion has been
        published, short of getting the book for each opinion and looking it up by hand.
    </p>
    <p>Neutral citations are a ground-swell effort to fix these problems by asking the courts themselves to affix
        citations to their work as they publish opinions on their websites. The system is very simple and takes the
        form of YEAR JURISDICTION NUMBER. So, for example, the first opinion from North Dakota in 2013 becomes <a
                href="/nd/5BmV/holkesvig-v-state/">2013 ND 1</a>. It's a very simple system that any court can begin
        using, and which many already have. We encourage all jurisdictions to adopt this system.
    </p>
    <p>Neutral citations have been officially recommended by the <a
            href="http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html">American Association
        of Law Libraries since 1995</a> and by the <a
            href="http://www.abanet.org/tech/ltrc/research/citation/report.html">American Bar Association since
        1996</a>. You can read more about neutral citations on the <a
            href="http://onward.justia.com/2010/12/17/public-domain-legal-citations/">Justia blog</a> or at <a
            href="http://universalcitation.org/">the website where they are being promoted</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="why-bulk">Why do you provide bulk data files?</h4>
    <p>Two groups tend to find this useful. First are academic researchers who wish to do empirical research
        on large portions of U.S. case law. They often cannot answer certain questions with full generality without
        including all or almost all opinions in their research. Second are legal technology startups or those who
        want to test out some new legal research tool. These groups can use the documents we have collected to test
        out a prototype of their new tools. Most regular users will not need to use our bulk downloads.</p>

    <h4 id="explain-fingerprint">What is the "fingerprint" of the document?</h4>
    <p>We generate these digital fingerprints for each document we retrieve from court websites. The algorithm that
        generates the fingerprint guarantees that the fingerprint generated will be unique for every file. If even
        one character is changed in a document, a different fingerprint will be generated. This helps us in our document
        retrieval process, so that if a court uses the same file name for a different document we will still detect
        that the document has changed and know to save it. This means it also helps us detect the rare instances where a
        file might be corrupted during the download process.
    </p>

    <p>If courts would publish these fingerprints as well, then we could develop tools that would allow our users
        to confirm that the backup copy on our site is identical to the version released by the court. Without that,
        users that wish to verify the authenticity of our backup copies would have to engage in the cumbersome process of
        downloading the document from the court, generating the fingerprint, download the document from us, generating
        the fingerprint from that copy, and then comparing the fingerprints to confirm that they are identical.

    </p>

    <h3 id="past-and-future">Past and Future</h3>
    <h4 id="orgin-story">What's the history of CourtListener?</h4>
    <p>CourtListener was Michael Lissner's capstone project while a student at the <a
            href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley, School of Information</a>, where he was
        advised by Brian Carver. The site <a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/blog/announcing-courtlistener">was
            launched in 2010</a> as a simple alert service for the Federal Appeals Courts. At that time, it had about
        130,000 opinions, a different search engine, and an extremely sparse interface.
    </p>

    <p>In 2013, Michael and Brian <a
            href="http://freelawproject.org/2013/09/24/non-profit-free-law-project-formed-to-create-an-open-legal-ecosystem/">created
        the Free Law Project</a> to support CourtListener and other related efforts.</p>

    <h4 id="future">What plans or features are in the works?</h4>
    <p>All of the planning for CourtListener is done in the open on <a
            href="https://trello.com/b/F3jrqway/flp-projects">our feature and bug tracker</a>. If you have ideas for
        the project that are not mentioned there, please tell us! We'd love to <a href="/contact/">hear your ideas</a>
        and we often prioritize our efforts in response to user requests.
