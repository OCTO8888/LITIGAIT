        <h2>Advanced Query Techniques</h2>

        <p class="top">CourtListener supports highly advanced Boolean queries. These allow you to build a complex search
            that can be run across our entire corpus.</p>

        <p>At present, the following Boolean connectors are supported:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Intersections AND</dt>
            <dd><p>This connector is used by default, and so is not usually needed. However, if you wish, you can
                explicitly create an AND comparison between words (e.g. <code>immigration AND borders</code>)</p></dd>

            <dt>Unions OR</dt>
            <dd><p>Creates an OR comparison between words (e.g. <code>immigration OR asylum</code>)</p></dd>

            <dt>Negation/exclusion -, !, NOT</dt>
            <dd><p>Requires that a word or phrase be excluded from the returned results (e.g. <code>immigration NOT
                "border patrol"</code>). This operator must be written in uppercase.</p></dd>

            <dt>Phrase queries " "</dt>
            <dd><p>Creates a phrase search (e.g. <code>"border patrol"</code>). In the case that quotation marks are not
                balanced (i.e. there is an odd number of them), they will be ignored.</p></dd>

            <dt>Grouped terms ( )</dt>
            <dd><p>Groups parts of a query (e.g. <code>(customs OR "border patrol") AND asylum</code>). Parentheses can
                be nested as deeply as desired.</p></dd>

            <dt>Fielded queries :</dt>
            <dd><p>In addition to being able to place fielded searches in the side bar, advanced users can also place
                fielded searches in their main query. For example, a search for <code>court_id:ca1
                    status:precedential</code> would return only precedential cases in the First Circuit of Federal
                Appeals. Parentheses can be used to create more complex queries. For example, <code>casename:(wade OR
                    roe)</code> would find cases containing "wade" or "roe" in the name of the case.</p>

                <p>The following fields can be used to place fielded searches: <strong>court_id, status, casename,
                    judge, docketnumber, citation and casenumber</strong>. casenumber is a shortcut for searching within
                    all citations and docket numbers simultaneously.</p>

                <p>Valid entries for the status field are precedential (p), non-precedential (u), published (p),
                    unpublished (u), relating-to (r), and in-chambers (i). The letter shown after the value is a valid
                    shortcut for the field. Precedential and published are considered equivalents, as are unpublished
                    and non-precedential.</p>

                <p>Valid entries for the court field are ca1, ca2, ca3, ca4, ca5, ca6, ca7, ca8, ca9, ca10, ca11, cadc,
                    cafc, scotus and so forth. If unknown, this value can be found in the URL for any case from the
                    desired court.</p>

                <p>Two experimental fields are also available: <strong>citecount</strong> and
                    <strong>suitnature</strong>. <code>citecount</code> searches allow you to search for opinions with a
                    specific number of other opinions citing them, but for range queries you'll want to use the Citation
                    Count slider. <code>suitnature</code> can be used to query the nature of various suits, where that
                    meta data is available. The data is not yet normalized, but intrepid users can experiment with this
                    feature now.</p></dd>

            <dt>Wildcards and Fuzzy Search *, ?, ~</dt>
            <dd><p>Using an asterisk (<strong>*</strong>) allows wildcard searches. For example, <code>immigra*</code>
                finds all words beginning with "immigra". This can also be used at the beginning or middle of words, at
                both the beginning and the end of a word, or even all three. For example, you can find all words
                containing two esses side-by-side with the following query: <code>*ss*</code>. You could also find words
                with two esses separated by other letters with a query such as: <code>*s*s*</code>. This would find
                cases containing words like "<strong>s</strong>u<strong>s</strong>an" or
                "as<strong>s</strong>i<strong>s</strong>tant".</p>

                <p>The question mark character (<strong>?</strong>) can be used similarly as a single letter wildcard.
                    For example, this would find cases containing the word "immigrant" or "emmigration":
                    <code>?mmigra*</code></p>

                <p>Fuzzy search can be applied using the tilde character (<strong>~</strong>) after a word. This is an
                    advanced parameter that allows searches for misspellings or different variations of a word's
                    spelling. For example, searching for <code>immigrant~</code> would find words similar to
                    "immigrant". Values can also be added after the tilde to indicate how similar different spellings
                    must be. The default value, if none is given, is 0.5. Values can range between 0 and 1, with 1 being
                    exact, and 0 being very sloppy. Fuzzy searches tend to broaden the result set, thus lowering
                    precision, but also casting a wider net.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Proximity ~</dt>
            <dd><p>Using a tilde character (<strong>~</strong>) after a phrase will ensure that the words in the phrase
                are within a desired distance of each other. For example <code>"border fence"~50</code> would find the
                words border and fence within 50 words of each other.</p></dd>

            <dt>Range queries [ ]</dt>
            <dd><p>Ranges can be queried by using brackets. For example, a search for <code>[1939 TO 1945]</code> would
                find all cases that contained the numbers 1939 to 1945, inclusive. Range queries can also be fielded,
                allowing searches like <code>westCite:([22 TO 23] F2)</code>, which would find all cases from volumes 22
                and 23 of the second series of the Federal Reporter. In range queries, the word 'TO' must be uppercase.
            </p></dd>

            <dt>Boosting ^</dt>
            <dd><p>When sorting by relevancy, the carrot character (<strong>^</strong>) can be used to give certain
                words more weight than others. For example, if you are interested in immigration cases that mention
                asylum, a query like the following will boost cases containing "asylum" higher in the results than they
                would be otherwise: <code>immigration asylum^5</code>. This is a way of telling the relevancy engine
                which terms are important in your query. Boosting can also be used after phrases, and by default is set
                to a value of 1.0.</p></dd>

            <dt>Case fingerprints</dt>
            <dd><p>Each case at CourtListener has a unique fingerprint that is generated using the <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1 hashing algorithm</a>. These fingerprints are
                displayed on the case pages, and can be used to locate a case in the future (e.g. a query for <code>17202b8ea46c3fc4434f803dd07e8ed4af041ab7</code>
                will always bring up <a href="/scotus/uwF/isabella-gonzales-appt-v-william-williams">Gonzales v.
                    Williams</a> as the first result).</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>These operators are all powered by the syntax of the Lucene search engine using the DisMax query parser. More
            details about these operators use can be found on <a
