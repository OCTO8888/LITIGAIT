            <p>Charts indicate the number of cases that we have in our database for
                a given year. These numbers include both precedential and non-precedential
                opinions for any given court.
            </p>

            <p>We have sourced our data from <a href="bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/">
                Resource.org</a>, a donation from Lawbox LLC. and directly from the
                court websites, with the following notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our coverage includes the majority of the Supreme Court record.
                    We sourced this from Resource.org and Lawbox LLC., which most people
                    consider complete for 1754 to 2004. Unfortunately, we have identified some
                    small gaps, especially around the very beginning of this corpus.
                </li>
                <li>F.3d and F.2d from Resource.org and Lawbox LLC. are included with no known gaps for
                    for the years 1950-2007.
                </li>
                <li>Starting in 2010 we have scraped opinions from many Federal
                    Court websites.
                </li>
                <li>We have scraped the historical content off many court
                    websites, merging it with F3 where appropriate.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe that our coverage of the Supreme Court and F3 is the best
                available on the open Web, but we admit we have some gaps in several of
                our other courts. If you have questions or would like more detail,
                please let us know.</p>
