        <h2>APIs and Bulk Data</h2>
        <p>We currently have two free APIs available to developers using our platform. If you are interested in obtaining large quantities of our data,
            we recommend using our <a href="/api/bulk-info/">bulk API</a>, which provides compressed XML files of our entire collection. If you wish
            to query our data programatically, we recommend using our <a href="/api/rest-info/">REST APIs</a>.

        <h3 id="pride">We're Proud of our Data</h3>
        <p>
            Over the past several years, we have made a significant investment in
            making our data the best on the open Web.
            Among the minor enhancements we make on a regular basis, we've made
            significant improvements to our data that you won't find in other
            sources:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We've <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2011/05/25/updated-supreme-court-case-dates-and-the-first-release-of-early-scotus-data-in-machine-readable-form/">
                added exact dates from the library of congress</a> to our collection
                of older Supreme Court cases, enhancing thousands of cases beyond what's
                available anywhere else.
            </li>
            <li>When we imported the Resource.org data, we <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2011/08/25/second-series-of-federal-reporter-from-1950-to-1993-now-on-courtlistener/">
                manually corrected</a> more than ten thousand omissions or
                errors in the data, ensuring that it's complete and accurate.
            </li>
            <li>Our data has <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2012/05/11/building-a-citator-on-courtlistener/">
                the citation network</a>, showing which cases reference each
                other, saving you the effort of building and testing a citation
                finding and matching algorithm yourself. Currently, we're working with
                researchers at USC to complete an audit of the citation network, the
                results of which will be folded back into our corpus.
            </li>
            <li>We complete complicated cleanup routines on the data, eliminating and
                fixing errant abbreviations like 'et al', 'U.S.A.' and the like.
            </li>
            <li>The data on CourtListener is a combination of many partial sources such
                as court websites, <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Resource.org</a>,
                and a donation from <a href="http://lawboxapps.com">Lawbox LLC.</a>
                This means that we have the best parts of all of our sources.
            </li>
            <li>
                We help you identify opinions that should be private. Many people don't want their
                case on the Web and have contacted us or Resource.org. In our data
                we provide a field indicating which cases should be kept private. In
                addition, we provide research about how to keep these cases out of
                search engines (more detail at right).

        <h3 id="privacy">Privacy Concerns</h3>
        <p>As is explained in our <a href="/removal/">removal policy</a>, we
            have blocked public search engines from indexing many of the cases available
            in our data (though they remain in our search engine).
            As you work with this data, please be cognizant of the privacy and safety
            issues involved with public-facing legal documents. This impacts real people
            with privacy issues such as informants in jail, people with stalkers, and
            foreign citizens with rejected asylum requests.</p>

        <p>If you wish to respect the privacy wishes of the parties involved,
            there is a field for each case, "<strong>blocked</strong>," which
            describes whether we have blocked search engines from indexing the case.
            The simple thing for you to do is to continue blocking
            such cases.</p>

        <p>
            For our approach to blocking, please see our <a href="/removal/">removal
            policy</a>. For our technical approach, please see the blog entries below. If
            you believe Robots.txt prevents a URL from appearing in search results,
            please be sure to check these out (it might not work as you expect):
