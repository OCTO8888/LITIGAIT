        <h2 id="about">XML Bulk Data</h2>
        <p>For hackers and legal analysts, we provide XML files of our data.
        We generate these files the first time they are requested, so some files
        may be very fast, while others may need to be created for you, which
        can take a moment. Bulk data files are available by the year, month and day.
        For each time period, individual bulk data files are available for each court,
        as well as a single file containing data from all courts.</p>

        <p>The XML information in the files should be self-explanatory, but we welcome discussion
            in <a href="http://lists.freelawproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dev">
            our developer forum</a> (preferred) or via our <a href="/contact/">contact page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>All time stamps are Pacific Standard Time.</p>


        <h3 id="usage">Requesting the Bulk Data Files</h3>
        <p>Annual, monthly or daily bulk data files can be accessed at
        https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk/<strong>year/month/day/court</strong>.xml.gz.</p>
        <p class="bottom">For example, let's look at ways to access the First Circuit of Appeals (<strong>ca1</strong>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All ca1 cases from 2009: <a href="/api/bulk/2009/ca1.xml.gz">
                https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk/<strong>2009/ca1</strong>.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 2009: <a href="/api/bulk/2009/06/ca1.xml.gz">
                https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk/2009/<strong>06</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 9, 2009: <a href="/api/bulk/2009/06/09/ca1.xml.gz">
                https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk/2009/06/<strong>09</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you would like <strong>all</strong> cases for a given time period,
        you can use <strong>all</strong> for the court name. For example,
        <a href="/api/bulk/2009/06/09/all.xml.gz">
        https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk/2009/06/09/<strong>all</strong>.xml.gz</a>
        returns all of the cases from June 9, 2009 (across all courts).</p>

        <p>We also provide a bulk data file of all cases up through the last day
        of the previous month. To obtain this file, simply omit the date
        in your query, and use <strong>all</strong> for the court name:
        <a href="/api/bulk/all.xml.gz">https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk/all.xml.gz</a>.
        This file is very large ({{dump_size}}). It's currently not possible to obtain complete
        data files for individual courts, due the processing required to generate such files.</p>

        <p>On the backend, bulk data files are generated when a GET request is placed on an /api/bulk/ endpoint
        and once the file is generated, you are redirected to its location on our server's disk.
        If the file was previously generated, you will be redirected immediately to a cached copy.
        This architecture is necessary on our backend and means that consumers of this API will need
        to automatically follow 302 redirects. If you are using cURL, this can be accomplished with
        the <code>-L</code> flag, and saving binaries can be done with the <code>-O</code> flag.
        Thus a complete GET request might look like:</p>
        <p><code>curl -L -O https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk/2009/06/09/ca9.xml.gz</code></p>

        <p>
            If you are interested in maintaining your system in sync with our data, you should look at
            <a href="/api/rest-info/">our REST API</a>, which provides resources sorted by modification date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that prior to November, 2013 these endpoints were previously located at <code>/dump-api/</code>. The
            old location will redirect you as necessary, but note that it will eventually go away.
