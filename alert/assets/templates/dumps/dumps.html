        <h2 id="about">XML Data Dumps</h2>
        <p>For hackers and legal analysts, we provide XML dumps of our data.
        We generate these files when they are requested, so some files may be
        very fast, while others may need to be created for you, which can take
        a moment. Dump files are available by the year, month and day.
        For each time period, individual dump files are available for each court,
        as well as a single file containing opinions from all courts.</p>

        <p>The XML information in the dumps should be self-explanatory, and can be
        discussed in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/courtlistener-discuss">
        our forum</a>.</p>

        <p>All time stamps are Pacific Standard Time.</p>


        <h3>Using the Dumps</h3>
        <p>Annual, monthly or daily dumps can be accessed at
        http://courtlistener.com/dump-api/<strong>year/month/day/court</strong>.xml.gz.</p>
        <p>For example, let's look at ways to access the First Circuit of Appeals (<strong>ca1</strong>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All ca1 cases from 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/<strong>2009/ca1</strong>.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/2009/<strong>06</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 9, 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/09/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/2009/06/<strong>09</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you would like <strong>all</strong> documents for a given time period,
        you can use <strong>all</strong> for the court name. For example,
        <a href="http://courtlistener.com/2009/06/09/all.xml.gz">
            http://courtlistener.com/2009/06/09/<strong>all</strong>.xml.gz</a>
            returns all of the cases from June 9, 2009 (across all courts).</p>
