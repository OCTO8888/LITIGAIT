        <h2 id="about">XML Data Dumps</h2>
        <p>For hackers and legal analysts, we provide XML dumps of our data.
        We generate these files the first time they are requested, so some files
        may be very fast, while others may need to be created for you, which
        can take a moment. Dump files are available by the year, month and day.
        For each time period, individual dump files are available for each court,
        as well as a single file containing opinions from all courts.</p>

        <p>The XML information in the dumps should be self-explanatory, and can be
        discussed in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/courtlistener-discuss">
        our forum</a> (preferred) or via our <a href="/contact/">contact page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>All time stamps are Pacific Standard Time.</p>


        <h3 id="usage">Using the Dumps</h3>
        <p>Annual, monthly or daily dumps can be accessed at
        http://courtlistener.com/dump-api/<strong>year/month/day/court</strong>.xml.gz.</p>
        <p class="bottom">For example, let's look at ways to access the First Circuit of Appeals (<strong>ca1</strong>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All ca1 cases from 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/<strong>2009/ca1</strong>.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/2009/<strong>06</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 9, 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/09/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/2009/06/<strong>09</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you would like <strong>all</strong> cases for a given time period,
        you can use <strong>all</strong> for the court name. For example,
        <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/09/all.xml.gz">
        http://courtlistener.com/dump-api/2009/06/09/<strong>all</strong>.xml.gz</a>
        returns all of the cases from June 9, 2009 (across all courts).</p>

        <p>We also provide a dump of all cases up through the last day
        of the previous month. To obtain this dump, simply omit the date
        in your query, and use <strong>all</strong> for the court name:
        <a href="/dump-api/all.xml.gz">http://courtlistener.com/dump-api/all.xml.gz</a>.
        This dump is currently very large ({{dump_size}}). It's currently not
        possible to obtain complete dumps for individual courts.</p>


        <h3>We're Proud of our Data</h3>
        <p>
            Over the past several years, we have made a significant investment in
            making our data the best on the open Web.
            Among the minor enhancements we make on a regular basis, we've made
            significant improvements to our data that you won't find in other
            sources:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We've <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2011/05/25/updated-supreme-court-case-dates-and-the-first-release-of-early-scotus-data-in-machine-readable-form/">
                added exact dates from the library of congress</a> to our collection
                of older Supreme Court cases, enhancing thousands of cases beyond what's
                available anywhere else.
            </li>
            <li>When we imported the Resource.org data, we <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2011/08/25/second-series-of-federal-reporter-from-1950-to-1993-now-on-courtlistener/">
                manually corrected</a> more than ten thousand omissions or
                errors in the data, ensuring that it's complete and accurate.
            </li>
            <li>Our data has <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2012/05/11/building-a-citator-on-courtlistener/">
                the citation network</a>, showing which cases reference each
                other, saving you the effort of building and testing a citation
                finding and matching algorithm yourself. Currently, we're working with
                researchers at USC to complete an audit of the citation network, the
                results of which will be folded back into our corpus.
            </li>
            <li>We complete complicated cleanup routines on the data, eliminating and
                fixing errant abbreviations like 'et al', 'U.S.A.' and the like.
            </li>
            <li>The data on CourtListener is a combination of many partial sources such
                as court websites, <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Resource.org</a>,
                and a donation from <a href="http://lawboxapps.com">Lawbox LLC.</a>
                This means that we have the best parts of all of our sources.
            </li>
            <li>
                We help handle the privacy issues for you. Many people don't want their
                case on the Web, and have contacted us or Resource.org. In our data
                we provide a field indicating which cases should be kept private,
                automatically including those cases listed in Resource.org's
                robots.txt file. In addition, we provide research about how to
                keep these cases out of search engines (more detail below).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            We believe that our data is the best on the open Web. We hope you agree,
            but if not, please feel free to tell us where we can improve.
        </p>


        <h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
        <p>As is explained in our <a href="/removal/">removal policy</a>, we
        have blocked search engines from indexing many of the cases available
        in our data. As you work with this data, please be cognizant of the
        privacy and safety issues involved.</p>

        <p>If you wish to respect the privacy wishes of the parties involved,
        there is a field for each case, "<strong>blocked</strong>," which
        describes whether we have blocked search engines from indexing the case.
        The simple thing for you to do in your project is to continue blocking
        such cases.</p>

        <p class="bottom">
            For our approach to blocking, please see our <a href="/removal/">removal
            policy</a>. We have also blogged several times on the subject and are
            happy to discuss our findings with interested parties:
