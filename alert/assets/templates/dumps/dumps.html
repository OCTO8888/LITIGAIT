        <h2 id="about">XML Data Dumps</h2>
        <p>For hackers and legal analysts, we provide XML dumps of our data.
        We generate these files the first time they are requested, so some files 
        may be very fast, while others may need to be created for you, which 
        can take a moment. Dump files are available by the year, month and day.
        For each time period, individual dump files are available for each court,
        as well as a single file containing opinions from all courts.</p>

        <p>The XML information in the dumps should be self-explanatory, and can be
        discussed in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/courtlistener-discuss">
        our forum</a>.</p>

        <p>All time stamps are Pacific Standard Time.</p>


        <h3>Using the Dumps</h3>
        <p>Annual, monthly or daily dumps can be accessed at
        http://courtlistener.com/dump-api/<strong>year/month/day/court</strong>.xml.gz.</p>
        <p class="bottom">For example, let's look at ways to access the First Circuit of Appeals (<strong>ca1</strong>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All ca1 cases from 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/<strong>2009/ca1</strong>.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/2009/<strong>06</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li>
            <li>All ca1 cases from June 9, 2009: <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/09/ca1.xml.gz">
                http://courtlistner.com/dump-api/2009/06/<strong>09</strong>/ca1.xml.gz</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you would like <strong>all</strong> cases for a given time period,
        you can use <strong>all</strong> for the court name. For example,
        <a href="/dump-api/2009/06/09/all.xml.gz">
        http://courtlistener.com/dump-api/2009/06/09/<strong>all</strong>.xml.gz</a>
        returns all of the cases from June 9, 2009 (across all courts).</p>
        
        <p>We also provide a dump of all cases up through the last day
        of the previous month. To obtain this dump, simply omit the date 
        in your query, and use <strong>all</strong> for the court name: 
        <a href="/dump-api/all.xml.gz">http://courtlistener.com/dump-api/all.xml.gz</a>. 
        This dump is currently very large ({{dump_size}}). It's currently not 
        possible to obtain complete dumps for individual courts.</p>    
        
        <h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
        <p>As is explained in our <a href="/removal/">removal policy</a>, we 
        have blocked search engines from indexing many of the cases available 
        in these dumps. As you work with this data, please be cognizant of the 
        privacy and safety issues involved.</p>
        
        <p>If you wish to respect the privacy wishes of the parties involved, 
        there is a field for each case, "<strong>blocked</strong>," which 
        describes whether we have blocked search engines from indexing the case.
        The simple thing for you to do in your project is to continue blocking
        such cases.</p>
        
        <p>For our approach to blocking, please see our <a href="/removal/">removal 
        policy</a> and our <a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/blog/respecting-privacy-while-providing-hundreds-of-thousands-of-public-documents">
        technical and policy</a> discussion of the issues.</p>
