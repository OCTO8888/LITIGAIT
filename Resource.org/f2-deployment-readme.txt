To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
 - Do F3
    - Fix the "change this doc" docs in F3
    - export/import the latest court db, and update the install script.
    - add fiscr to the various places on the site where it's needed...
