JURISCRAPER:
 - Pre deployment:
    - Make a revision with the maintenance sign in place.
    - Make another revision without it.
    - Check in the latest juriscraper
 - Deployment:
    - kill the scraper if it's running
    - hg pull -u -r REVISION WITH MAINTENANCE
    - ran
    - manage.py migrate search
        - deletes a column, renames another -- should be fast? 
    - sudo ./install.sh --juriscraper
    - hg pull -u (takes down the maintenance sign)

BUGS:
 - Atom feeds for courts fail silently.
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.
 - Scrapers aren't working well.
 - OCR needs to be finished

Content Extraction:
 - investigate Apache Tika
 
Solr:
 - fix the overlapping counts for log court names in the sidebar.
 

Big picture:
 - fix the issue with the crawler creating docs that lack citations
 - fix the sitemaps
 - F3
 - OCR
 - recrawl
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
 - Do F3
    - Fix the "change this doc" docs in F3
    - export/import the latest court db, and update the install script.
    - add fiscr to the various places on the site where it's needed...
