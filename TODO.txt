BUGS:
 - JS bug with the check all 
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.
 - selecting "New Search" resets the filters to have all the statuses selected
 - Add state courts to the front end
 - Tab index fail on saving favorite.
 
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
