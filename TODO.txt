BUGS:
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.
 - Court-based RSS feeds need to be Solr-powered, or at least be non-locking
 - selecting "New Search" resets the filters to have all the statuses selected
 - add/expose neutral citations and state courts
    - QA:
        - will the scraper work properly? Try Wisconsin (which has neutral citations) and try West Virginia (which doesn't) 
    - Deployment:
        - DB migration is needed, so:
            - Check in version with maint warning then one without
            - pull the version with the maint warning
            - restart apache
            - manage.py migrate search
            - hg pull -u
        - delete dumps (they need regeneration)
        - run: manage.py dumpdata search.Court (then put this in install.sh)
    
 - Add state courts to the front end

Content Extraction:
 - investigate Apache Tika
 
Solr:
 - fix the overlapping counts for long court names in the sidebar.
 

Big picture:
 - F3
    - Remove courts.gov/c/F3/166/166.F3d.507.98-7803.1065.html (Carl's request)
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
 - Move the crt.li apache conf over to the repo
   
   
F3
 - Fix the "change this doc" docs in F3
 - export/import the latest court db, and update the install script.
 - add fiscr to the various places on the site where it's needed...
 - rerun the robots.txt script that imports from resource.org
 - kill all related dumps and sitemaps
 - optimize the MySQL DB and Solr index
