BUGS:
 - New code for saving pdf makes 404s.
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.
 - selecting "New Search" resets the filters to have all the statuses selected
 - Add state courts to the front end
 - Tab index fail on saving favorite.
 - Your Notes needs pointer and proper collapsing.
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
 - Move the crt.li apache conf over to the repo
 - Add citation pages to sitemaps (human and computer)
   
   
F3
 - do the hand file
 - why three fiscr on coverage page, and one in facets?
 - what's up with the courts I added to the DB that didn't get any F3 stuff?
