BUGS:
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.
 - Various bugs reported by celery
 - Court-based RSS feeds need to be Solr-powered, or at least be non-locking
 - selecting "New Search" resets the filters to have all the statuses selected
 - add/expose neutral citations:
    - front end
    - search form
    - solr config (does this break things?)
    - data model
    - search object
    - results
    - rendered view
    - delete dumps
 - Rework extract_missed_docs to use argparser
 - Add state courts to the front end

Content Extraction:
 - investigate Apache Tika
 
Solr:
 - fix the overlapping counts for long court names in the sidebar.
 

Big picture:
 - F3
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
   
   
F3
 - Fix the "change this doc" docs in F3
 - export/import the latest court db, and update the install script.
 - add fiscr to the various places on the site where it's needed...
 - rerun the robots.txt script that imports from resource.org
 - kill all related dumps and sitemaps
 - optimize the MySQL DB and Solr index
