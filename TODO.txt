BUGS:
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.
 - Court-based RSS feeds need to be Solr-powered, or at least be non-locking
 - selecting "New Search" resets the filters to have all the statuses selected
 - Add state courts to the front end
 
Solr:
 - fix the overlapping counts for long court names in the sidebar.
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
 - Move the crt.li apache conf over to the repo
