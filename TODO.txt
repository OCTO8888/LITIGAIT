BUGS:
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.
 - Court-based RSS feeds need to be Solr-powered, or at least be non-locking
 - selecting "New Search" resets the filters to have all the statuses selected
 - Add state courts to the front end
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
 - Move the crt.li apache conf over to the repo
   
   
F3
 - do the hand file
 - why three fiscr on coverage page, and one in facets?
 - what's up with the courts I added to the DB that didn't get any F3 stuff?

Citations:
 - re-enable backups
 - Make the celery user able to do things to www-data files
 - check if disabling the save signal is needed every time, or just the once (perhaps why docs aren't saved?)
        - actually, this is *exactly* why. We need to be more granular in how we disable the save signal. 
 - solr pipeline

Dumps:
  - add citation info
  - add absolute urls
