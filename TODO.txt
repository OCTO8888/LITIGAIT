BUGS:
 - Atom feeds for courts fail silently.
 - HTML docs with ampersands show the ampersands in the highlighted text.

Content Extraction:

Solr:
 - fix the overlapping counts for log court names in the sidebar.
 

Big picture:

 - recrawl
 
To do:
 - check out the outliars in the DB by date
 - recreate the stat_maker.py script (see bug)
 - Check the dates/courts in Brian's list of citation-less docs, and see if we
   missed any docs.
 - Do F3
    - Fix the "change this doc" docs in F3
    - export/import the latest court db, and update the install script.
    - add fiscr to the various places on the site where it's needed...
