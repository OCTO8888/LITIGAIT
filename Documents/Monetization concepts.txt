These are ideas for making this project solvent. Current costs are low, but they
will grow with every query and alert that is in the system. The goal here isn't 
to make a fortune - It's to not lose money. This file exists to keep track of 
ideas until they can be tried out, considered in more detail, etc.

Order of ideas lacks relevancy.

1. Service to send PDFs along with alerts as attachments
   + nice feature
   + easy to implement
   + makes people's lives easier
   + subscription model
   - bandwidth cost (maybe)
   - less traffic on site (maybe)
2. Curated alerts people can buy. For example, for a buck we could sell
hand-crafted alerts for various areas of the law.
    + useful feature
    + helps attorneys that need to do due diligence staying up to date ("I used 
        a special alert system to stay up to date!")
    + could be cheap, like a buck or so per alert
    + no added CPU/bandwidth costs
    - could be subscription or one-off model
    - work and expertise required to create/update/maintain alerts
    - might be a better community-based thing
3. Sell our data to people that want it.
    + almost effortless
    + contributes to more data being in the world
    + one off or subscription probably possible
    - enables competition
    - not nice to sell it, should probably give it away (as in resource.org)
4. Advertising
    + very easy to implement
    + powers much of the Internet
    + could have high-value eyes
    - lameness of site goes up...a lot.
