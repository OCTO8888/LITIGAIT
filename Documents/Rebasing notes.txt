Notes on rebasing the project:
 - Lots of things point to the directory where things are installed, and need to be updated. This is why I've been lazy about it. My bad.
 
Things to update:
 - apache config for Piwik and django (restart server)
 - link to django in the python config:
    - cd /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
    - rm django
    - ln -s /home/mlissner/Documents/Cal/FinalProject/django/django django
 - any links in your settings files (restart server if changes made)
 - links in the development section of URLs.py
 - Sphinx config
 - Bash aliases
