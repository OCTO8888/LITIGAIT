	abstract = {From the {Book:In} writing this book I tried to achieve two different objectives. The first objective was to provide an overview of fast-track, the techniques it applies, and particularly the management challenges it presents. The second objective was to provide a handbook for project managers running fast-track projects. Putting these together might have endangered the second, and more pragmatic objective. This I did not want to do, so the book is split into two distinct parts. Chapters 1 to 3 deal with fast-track in general, Chapter 4 to 7 deal with the life-cycle of a project in more detail, identifying the tasks and their deliverable, the techniques and the tools that support them. These later chapters refer back to the relevant sections of the first part of the book so the descriptions of specific techniques are all gathered together in Chapter 3 and not scattered and duplicated through subsequent {chapters.I} hope that this structure will mean a casual reader can gain an understanding of the fast-track approach quickly from the first part of the book, and the practitioner can have an organized and compact reference for daily use from the second {part.In} assembling the second part I frequently found myself adding an extra step or an additional task, for completeness. The result is that, while not all projects will need every step of every task, they are all necessary under some circumstances. Every task is included in a project on the basis of what it produces. If a particular project has no need of the result, for example, documentation of test results, then it should not be produced and the task should be omitted. During the initial planning of a project the template project plan offeredin Chapters 4 to 6 should be assessed and tailored for the project, cutting out the unnecessary tasks and steps. Do not be afraid to prune. The questions to ask are: {"Do} I need this deliverable to manage the project?" and {"Does} the sponsor value this deliverable above its price?" I have used Oracle tools throughout in examples, and in particular I have recommended an approach that exploits the ability of the Oracle {CASE} tools to define rules once then reuse them many times. Some {CASE} tools do not exploit reusability in this way, but the trend in development technology is towards greater reusability so it seems very appropriate {here.Dai} {CleggJuly} 1994},
