Install instructions for the courtlistener project

For debian-based computers, the install.sh script should install all dependencies
that exist on your computer, as well as set up the software.

For other operating systems, it should serve as good documentation of the installation
process and components.

If you work on the installation process, please consider updating the script or this
documentation.
