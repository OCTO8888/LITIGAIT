Install instructions for the courtlistener project
--------------------------------------------------

For debian-based computers:
 - copy the install.sh script to your computer
 - run it with the following command: sudo ./install.sh

It will install all dependencies that are required for the software.

For other operating systems, where the install script will not work, the script
should serve as good documentation of the installation process and components.

If you work on the installation process, please consider updating the script or this
documentation.
