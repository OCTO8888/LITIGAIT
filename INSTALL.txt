Install instructions for the courtlistener project
--------------------------------------------------

Previous to 2013-01-25, CL had an install script that attempted to install 
everything on your computer for you. It was hundreds of lines long, poorly 
maintained and when it broke (which it often did), people were usually stumped
how to proceed. You can still find it in the repository, if you're so inclined.

Going forward, it's a hands-on approach, where you install and configure 
everything manually. That's the bad news, because it means more work for you, 
humble coder. The good news is that we have copious notes about how to do this, 
and they're even in a wiki, so you can edit them if needed. 

Here they are: https://bitbucket.org/mlissner/search-and-awareness-platform-courtlistener/wiki/HowTo

Please don't hesitate to get in touch in the forum if you have questions.

We encourage your changes and look forward to your contributions,

Mike & Brian
