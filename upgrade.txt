This file contains notes for upgrades when special instructions are necessary. In general, simply doing an

hg pull -u

is all that's necessary. In the case that special instructions are needed, we will attempt to put them here, with the

 - Numerous changes to the models have been made to rename variables. Please update your database after pulling the
   code. This should be an instant migration in PostGres.

   manage.py migrate search

 - The dependency on the requests library has been updated to version 1.2.3:

   sudo pip uninstall requests
   sudo apt-get purge python-requests
   sudo pip install requests==1.2.3

 - The scrape_and_extract.py script has been converted to the cl_scrape_and_extract management command. It is API
   compatible in terms of args, but any jobs calling the script will need to be updated.
