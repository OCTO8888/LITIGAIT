This file contains notes for upgrades when special instructions are necessary. In general, simply doing an

hg pull -u

is all that's necessary. In the case that special instructions are needed, we will attempt to put them here, with the
most recent at the top.

2013-06-19:
 - Numerous changes to the models have been made to rename variables. Please update your database after pulling the
   code. Note that this may take some time (untested on large DBs):

   manage.py migrate search

 - The dependency on the requests library has been updated to version 1.2.3:

   sudo pip uninstall requests
   sudo apt-get purge python-requests
   sudo pip install requests==1.2.3
