This file contains notes for upgrades when special instructions are necessary. In general, simply doing:

hg pull -u
sudo -u www-data /var/www/court-listener/alert/manage.py collectstatic
manage.py migrate

is all that's necessary. In the case that special instructions are needed, we will attempt to put them here, with the
most recent at the top.

We welcome a conversion of these notes to a better process using Fabric.

 - TODO: Does the fact that lawbox cases lack a URL cause an issue in the UI or can they be treated like the Resource.org cases?
 - TODO: If we do case merging, the source field should be LBM ("LawBox Merged.")
 - TODO: In the constants.py file, I've reassigned REPORTERS = CL_REPORTERS. This should get ironed out.
 - TODO: Investigate whether it's worth reworking the citation finder so that it better understands neutral citations.
         For example, right now a citation like 2012 NM 3 will get 3 as citation.page, and will get 2012 as
         citation.volume
   TODO: Update match_citation to use date fields as return values from the REPORTER_DATES lookup.

 - The piwik configuration has been merged into the virtual host for the main site. If you are using piwik, you will
   need to restart your apache server to enable this configuration. After this change, piwik will be located at
   /piwik rather than as a subdomain.


2013-07-03:
 - Adds a notes field to the Courts model. Migrate your database with:

    manage.py migrate search

   And you'll be good to go.

2013-06-27:
 - This release will require downtime and will put your site into management mode upon pulling it.
 - judge, suitNature and citeCount have been added to the Solr configuration. judges and nature_of_suit have been added
   to the Document model.Unfortunately, these require a recrawl of the database into the Solr index and a migration of
   the database. To realize these changes:

     sudo -u www-data pull -u
     sudo service apache2 restart # Welcome to management mode.
     sudo servce scraper stop
     manage.py migrate search
     manage.py cl_update_index --delete --everything
     sudo service solr restart
     sudo service celeryd restart
     manage.py cl_update_index --update --everything
     sudo servce scraper start

   There have also been changes to the settings to enable staticfiles as indicated below, and settings have been
   overhauled to make them much simpler.

   To effect the changes to settings, copy 05-private.example to 05-private.py, and edit it as needed. Once complete,
   delete 20-private.py or rename it with a different extension, if you need a backup.

   At this point your system should be upgraded, and you can disable the management mode in urls.py, then restart apache
   again.

 - We've moved to using django.contrib.staticfiles[1]. This introduces better management of static files and moves CL
   towards standard Django practices in versions >= 1.3, but presents several changes for the project:
    - When deploying, there are new commands that must be run if there are any new static files:
       manage.py collectstatic
    - The locations of static files have been distributed to either the app they correspond with or to a new directory,
      "alert/assets/static-global", that contains static items that have a global scope across apps. Within each app
      there is a /static/ directory where their own static files should go. Files are not served from these locations,
      but are instead collected into the "alert/assets/static/" directory upon deploying the app.
    - Changes have been made to the apache configuration which will make it serve files from the new location. These
      changes require that Apache be restarted after pulling from hg.
    - urls.py has been simplified, since django.contrib.staticfiles serves static files automatically when
      DEBUG == True.
    - Nearly all templates have been altered to use this app, introducing the possibility of missing images, css or JS.

2013-06-20:
 - The add_citations script has been converted to a management command. Any previous usages of it will need to be
   updated to use manage.py cl_add_citations_to_docs. It remains mostly API compatible, but management commands do
   not support variable numbers of arguments so the doc_ids parameter is now doc_id. It takes an int instead of an
   iterable.

2013-06-19:
 - Numerous changes to the models have been made to rename variables. Please update your database after pulling the
   code. This should be an instant migration in PostGres.

     manage.py migrate search

 - The dependency on the requests library has been updated to version 1.2.3:

   sudo pip uninstall requests
   sudo apt-get purge python-requests
   sudo pip install requests==1.2.3

 - The scrape_and_extract.py script has been converted to the cl_scrape_and_extract management command. It is API
   compatible in terms of args, but any jobs calling the script will need to be updated.
