To do:
 - Make a solution so that the notes can be displayed properly on the favorites page
 - Make the sidebar items have more vertical height between them.
 - ESC should close the modal box.
 - No search box on the sign-in-register, sign-on, or register pages (it steals focus)
 - make sure things work as anonymous users (right now, things fail).
 - create a redirect from /profile/ --> /profile/settings/ (make URLs guessable).
 - auto-expand the search-tips sidebar when there are zero results. It's a teaching moment.


Favorites spec:

Page is loaded:
    if user is logged in and page is favorite:
        DONE - Display the gold star
        DONE - In the sidebar, load any notes or tags they have for the item.
    else:
        display the hollow star, with a popup asking the user to log in.

Favorites page is loaded:
    List the favorites with casename, tags and notes. Provide a delete link,
        which deletes the item with a confirm box (using the same code as above).
        After an item is deleted, use JS to remove it from the list.

Delete account mechanism needs to be updated to delete a user's favorites.
