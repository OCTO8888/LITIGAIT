To do:
 - make sure things work as anonymous users (right now, things fail).
 - test the delete button
 - test the edit/delete button on the faves page.
 - ensure that URL/POST data hacking can't edit other user's stuff
 - make sure that we're properly filtering on the users, so that favorites are
   user-specific.
 - check for print statements! check for the word tag.

Tests:
 - what happens when input is too long in the form field?
 - does text get truncated properly on the profile --> favorite page?


Favorites spec:

Page is loaded:
    if user is logged in and page is favorite:
        DONE - Display the gold star
        DONE - In the sidebar, load any notes or tags they have for the item.
    else:
        display the hollow star, with a popup asking the user to log in.

Favorites page is loaded:
    List the favorites with casename, tags and notes. Provide a delete link,
        which deletes the item with a confirm box (using the same code as above).
        After an item is deleted, use JS to remove it from the list.

Delete account mechanism needs to be updated to delete a user's favorites.
